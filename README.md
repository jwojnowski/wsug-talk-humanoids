# Human(o)IDs — designing IDs for both machines AND humans
Slides for the talk given at the [Wrocław Scala User Group](https://www.meetup.com/wroclaw-scala-user-group/events/301754493/) on July 2nd, 2024.

## Abstract
Are Software Engineers human? While we can’t answer that with certainty, we can pretend we are human and try to make our lives a bit easier by making ever-present IDs more human-friendly and, with help of some not-so-widely-used Scala features, type-safe at the same time.
